# BelajarMenulis-Kaganga

The goal of this project is to create an interactive mobile application that helps users learn how to write Aksara Kaganga, a script used in the Rejang Lebong language. The application aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience through various features and exercises.

Features:

1. Learning Materials: The app will offer a structured curriculum that introduces users to the Aksara Kaganga script. It will include lessons on character recognition, stroke order, and pronunciation. The materials can be presented as text, images, or videos to accommodate different learning preferences.

3. Character Repository: The app will include a comprehensive repository of Aksara Kaganga characters. Users can access the repository to view and study the script's various characters, their meanings, and contextual usage. This will serve as a reference guide for learners.
4. Quizzes and Assessments: The app will incorporate quizzes and assessments to evaluate the users' progress. These interactive exercises can include multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blanks, or character matching. Instant feedback and scoring will provide learners with a sense of achievement and areas for improvement.
5. Progress Tracking: The app will track users' progress throughout their learning journey. It can include features like achievement badges, progress charts, and statistics to help learners visualize their advancement and stay motivated.
6. Social Features: Users can have the option to connect with other learners through the app. They can join communities, share their progress, ask questions, and engage in discussions related to Aksara Kaganga learning. This fosters a collaborative and supportive learning environment.
